# DeFuncto
Functional library for C#, aiming to keep the minimum data types for ease of maintenance.

Heavily inspired by [language-ext](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext), but keeping it closer to F# most used structures and with a much less ambitious scope, making it easier to keep it up to date with the latest versions of the language.

# Declarative programming
Declarative programming is a paradigm in which we define _what_ do we want the program to do without specifying steps to follow to achieve a goal, but instead describing a program out of composing expressions.

In functional programming (a subset of declarative programming) this is achieved by passing data from one function to the next one without making changes to existing data. To represent modifications, we create new data with the desired modifications.
